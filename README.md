# Project 1 - *Flicks App*

**Flicks App** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **8** hours 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality were completed:

- [ ] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [ ] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [ ] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to add in specific filters to app to specify genres of movies or top rated.
2. How to add a favorites or bookmarks to app.
